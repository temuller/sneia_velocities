# SNe Ia Silicon Velocities

In this repository, SNe Ia from PESSTO are retrieved from the [ESO archive](https://archive.eso.org/eso/eso_archive_main.html) to measure their Silicon velocities using their spectra.


## SNe Ia Sample

The sample is taken from the PESSTO data releases: http://archive.eso.org/dataset/ADP.2021-03-23T16:54:33.538

The sample is retrieved using the [Phase 3 query interface](http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_main/form?phase3_collection=PESSTO). Only EFOSC spectra is used. Remember to set the `Return max:` to something like `9000 rows` and `Output preferences:` to `ascii csv/download`.
